### Conference Location

MCM 2025 will take place in Chicago. Greater Chicago is home to several research universities and two United States Department of Energy research laboratories.  Chicago is a major transportation hub, which will facilitate scholars from all over the world coming together to share the latest developments in Monte Carlo methods.

The conference will be held at Hermann Hall (HH) and Wishnick Hall (WH) at the Mies (main) campus of the Illinois Institute of Technology, which is situated a few miles south of downtown and accessible by public transportation.

### Guidance for Presenters
Thank you for sharing with us your latest insight.  Be aware that your audience will likely include experts as well as the curious.  Please make the first one-third of your talk accessible to a general audience.

* Plenary speakers please keep your talk to **50 minutes** to allow time for a robust discussion afterward.
* Special sesion and contributed talk speakers, please keep your talk to under **22 minutes** to allow for discussion and the set up of the next speaker.

To allow the smooth flow of talks, we ask all speakers to do the following:

* Upload your slides using this Google form: [tinyurl.com/MCM2025Slides](https://tinyurl.com/MCM2025Slides)  **at least two hours before your talk**.
*  Uploads must be in pdf or ppt format.
*  If you revise your slides, please submit an updated copy using the same link, but with a different file name.
*  Slides will reside on a shared drive.
*  When you upload your slides, you may specify whether or not you want conferees to be able to view them.
*  As a safeguard, bring a copy of your slides on a USB drive.
*  Go the room where you will present at least 10 minutes before the start of your session to familiarize yourself with the room and ensure that your slides are accessible.

Slides will be presented using the computers in the lecture rooms.  A conference assistant will help the speakers access the slides when giving their presentations.

* Keep track of time and give reminders to speakers at the 5-minute and 2-minute marks.
	* Visual reminders of the time will be provided.
	* For sessions with fewer talks, keep to the schedule so that participants who may go between sessions will know the start and stop time.
	* If there is an empty slot, feel free to facilitate an informal discussion if there is interest.

The conference assistant will perform these steps but they are included for your reference.

### Other Technology

#### Internet Access

Illinois Tech is a partner with eduroam, and you can get internet access via that route if your institution is an eduroam partner.

Another option is to log onto the Illinois Tech internet through [IIT-Connect](https://www.iit.edu/ots/internet-network/illinois-tech-wireless-networks/guest-wireless) 

* When associating to IIT-Connect, a captive portal page loads which provides guests the ability to sign in directly or self register. Self registration requires a phone number to receive an SMS message with login credentials. 

* There is also guest account, MCM25, which you can use to connect to IIT-Connect.  The password will be posted at the registration desk.  This account does not require registration.  

#### Electrical Power

In the United States, the standard voltage is 120V at a frequency of 60Hz.  The standard power plugs are

* Type A (two flat parallel pins) and
* Type B (two flat parallel pins plus a round grounding pin).

#### Printing
We do not have printers available at the conference venue, but you may print your documents at
